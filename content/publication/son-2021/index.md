abstract: Drought forecasting is crucial to minimize the damage to food security and
  water resources caused by drought. Satellite-based drought research has been conducted
  since 1980s, which includes drought monitoring, assessment, and prediction. Unlike
  numerous studies on drought monitoring and assessment for the past few decades,
  satellite-based drought forecasting has gained popularity in recent years. For successful
  drought forecasting, it is necessary to carefully identify the relationships between
  drought factors and drought conditions by drought type and lead time. This paper
  aims to provide an overview of recent research trends and challenges for satellite-based
  drought forecasts focusing on lead times. Based on the recent literature survey
  during the past decade, the satellite-based drought forecasting studies were divided
  into three groups by lead time (i.e., short-term, sub-seasonal, and seasonal) and
  reviewed with the characteristics of the predictors (i.e., drought factors) and
  predictands (i.e., drought indices). Then, three major challenges–difficulty in
  model generalization, model resolution and feature selection, and saturation of
  forecasting skill improvement–were discussed, which led to provide several future
  research directions of satellite-based drought forecasting.
