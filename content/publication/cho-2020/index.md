abstract: The reliable and robust monitoring of air temperature distribution is essential
  for urban thermal environmental analysis. In this study, a stacking ensemble model
  consisting of multi-linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and
  random forest (RF) optimized by the SVR is proposed to interpolate the daily maximum
  air temperature (Tmax) during summertime in a mega urban area. A total of 10 geographic
  variables, including the clear-sky averaged land surface temperature and the normalized
  difference vegetation index, were used as input variables. The stacking model was
  compared to Cokriging, three individual data-driven methods, and a simple average
  ensemble model, all through leave-one-station-out cross validation. The stacking
  model showed the best performance by improving the generalizability of the individual
  models and mitigating the sensitivity to the extreme daily Tmax. This study demonstrates
  that the stacking ensemble method can improve the accuracy of spatial interpolation
  of environmental variables in various research fields.
