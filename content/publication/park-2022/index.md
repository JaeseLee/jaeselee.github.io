abstract: Drought affects a region's economy intensively and its severity is based
  on the level of infrastructure present in the affected region. Therefore, it is
  important not only to reflect on the conventional environmental properties of drought,
  but also on the infrastructure of the target region for adequate assessment and
  mitigation. Various drought indices are available to interpret the distinctive meteorological,
  agricultural, and hydrological characteristics of droughts. However, these drought
  indices do not consider the effective assessment of damage of drought impact. In
  this study, we evaluated the applicability of satellite-based drought indices over
  North Korea and South Korea, which have substantially different agricultural infrastructure
  systems to understand their characteristics. We compared satellite-based drought
  indices to in situ-based drought indices, standardized precipitation index (SPI),
  and rice yield over the Korean Peninsula. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
  (MODIS), tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM), and global land data assimilation
  system (GLDAS) data from 2001 to 2018 were used to calculate drought indices. The
  correlations of the indices in terms of monitoring meteorological and agricultural
  droughts in rice showed opposite correlation patterns between the two countries.
  The difference in the prevailing agricultural systems including irrigation resulted
  in different impacts of drought. Vegetation condition index (VCI) and evaporative
  stress index (ESI) are best suited to assess agricultural drought under well-irrigated
  regions as in South Korea. In contrast, most of the drought indices except for temperature
  condition index (TCI) are suitable for regions with poor agricultural infrastructure
  as in North Korea.
