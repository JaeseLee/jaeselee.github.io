 abstract = {Drought affects a region's economy intensively and its severity is based on the level of infrastructure present in the affected region. Therefore, it is important not only to reflect on the conventional environmental properties of drought, but also on the infrastructure of the target region for adequate assessment and mitigation. Various drought indices are available to interpret the distinctive meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological characteristics of droughts. However, these drought indices do not consider the effective assessment of damage of drought impact. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of satellite-based drought indices over North Korea and South Korea, which have substantially different agricultural infrastructure systems to understand their characteristics. We compared satellite-based drought indices to in situ-based drought indices, standardized precipitation index (SPI), and rice yield over the Korean Peninsula. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM), and global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) data from 2001 to 2018 were used to calculate drought indices. The correlations of the indices in terms of monitoring meteorological and agricultural droughts in rice showed opposite correlation patterns between the two countries. The difference in the prevailing agricultural systems including irrigation resulted in different impacts of drought. Vegetation condition index (VCI) and evaporative stress index (ESI) are best suited to assess agricultural drought under well-irrigated regions as in South Korea. In contrast, most of the drought indices except for temperature condition index (TCI) are suitable for regions with poor agricultural infrastructure as in North Korea.},
