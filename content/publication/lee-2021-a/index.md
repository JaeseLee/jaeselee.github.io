abstract: Leaf area index (LAI) provides valuable information necessary for sustainable
  and effective management of forests. Although global high resolution LAI data are
  provided by European Space Agency using Sentinel-2 satellite images, they have not
  considered forest characteristics in model development and have not been evaluated
  for various forest ecosystems in South Korea. In this study, we proposed a LAI estimation
  model combining machine learning and the PROSAIL radiative transfer model using
  Sentinel-2 satellite data over a local forest area in South Korea. LAI-2200C was
  used to measure in situ LAI data. The proposed LAI estimation model was compared
  to the existing Sentinel-2 LAI product. The results showed that the proposed model
  outperformed the existing Sentinel-2 LAI product, yielding a difference of bias
  âˆ¼ 0.97 and a difference of root-mean-square-error - 0.81 on average, respectively,
  which improved the underestimation of the existing product. The proposed LAI estimation
  model provided promising results, implying its use for effective LAI estimation
  over forests in South Korea.
