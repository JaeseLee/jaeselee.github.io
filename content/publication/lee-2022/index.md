abstract: Three widely used primary soil moisture (SM) data sources, namely, in-situ
  measurements, satellite observations, and land surface models (LSM), possess different
  characteristics. This study combined three SM data sources using machine learning
  (ML) random forest, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and
  simple averaging ensemble approaches to produce improved daily SM data over the
  contiguous United States (CONUS). For each ML model, three schemes were tested using
  different independent variables, namely, satellite-derived, LSM-derived, and both.
  Triple collocation analysis (TCA) was adopted to address the scale mismatch problem
  between in-situ and coarse gridded SM data. The proposed approach was evaluated
  using the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), Soil Moisture Active Passive
  Core Validation Sites (SMAP CVS), and TCA. In the ISMN-based evaluation, the proposed
  ML-based ensemble generally produced better evaluation metrics and showed robust
  skills over topographically complex and densely vegetated regions where existing
  SM products showed poor skills. The SMAP CVS-based evaluation demonstrated that
  the ML ensemble approach yielded a better performance than the existing SM datasets,
  resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.78, unbiased root mean squared difference
  of 0.035 m3/m3, and bias of 0.006 m3/m3. In addition, the TCA results additionally
  confirmed that the ML-based ensemble had better spatiotemporal quality than the
  other SM products. The data-driven approach proposed in this study has three major
  novelties (1) the proposed ML-based method synergistically merges various data sources
  to improve SM; (2) the performance of the proposed ML-based SM was robust to topography
  and vegetation; and (3) the average ensemble of three ML models additionally improves
  performances. The SM time-series data generated by the proposed approach are expectedly
  suitable variables for environmental and climate applications over CONUS. The research
  findings suggest that ML algorithms can be effectively used for modeling dynamic
  soil moisture.
