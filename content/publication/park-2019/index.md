abstract: Drought is one of the factors that can cause wildfires. Drought is related
  to not only the occurrence of wildfires but also their frequency, extent and severity.
  In South Korea, most wildfires occur in dry seasons (i.e. spring and autumn), which
  are highly correlated to drought events. In this study, we examined the relationship
  between wildfire occurrence and drought factors, and developed satellite-based new
  drought indices for assessing wildfire risk over South Korea. Drought factors used
  in this study were high-resolution downscaled soil moisture, Normalized Different
  Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI), Normalized Different
  Drought Index (NDDI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Precipitation Condition
  Index (PCI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Drought indices were then proposed
  through weighted linear combination and one-class support vector machine (One-class
  SVM) using the drought factors. We found that most drought factors, in particular,
  soil moisture, NDWI, and PCI were linked well to wildfire occurrence. The validation
  results using wildfire cases in 2018 showed that all five linear combinations produced
  consistently good performance (> 88% in occurrence match). In particular, the combination
  of soil moisture and NDWI, and the combination of soil moisture, NDWI, and precipitation
  were found to be appropriate for representing wildfire risk.
