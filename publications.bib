abstract = {The reliable and robust monitoring of air temperature distribution is essential for urban thermal environmental analysis. In this study, a stacking ensemble model consisting of multi-linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF) optimized by the SVR is proposed to interpolate the daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) during summertime in a mega urban area. A total of 10 geographic variables, including the clear-sky averaged land surface temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index, were used as input variables. The stacking model was compared to Cokriging, three individual data-driven methods, and a simple average ensemble model, all through leave-one-station-out cross validation. The stacking model showed the best performance by improving the generalizability of the individual models and mitigating the sensitivity to the extreme daily Tmax. This study demonstrates that the stacking ensemble method can improve the accuracy of spatial interpolation of environmental variables in various research fields.},

abstract = {Drought forecasting is crucial to minimize the damage to food security and water resources caused by drought. Satellite-based drought research has been conducted since 1980s, which includes drought monitoring, assessment, and prediction. Unlike numerous studies on drought monitoring and assessment for the past few decades, satellite-based drought forecasting has gained popularity in recent years. For successful drought forecasting, it is necessary to carefully identify the relationships between drought factors and drought conditions by drought type and lead time. This paper aims to provide an overview of recent research trends and challenges for satellite-based drought forecasts focusing on lead times. Based on the recent literature survey during the past decade, the satellite-based drought forecasting studies were divided into three groups by lead time (i.e., short-term, sub-seasonal, and seasonal) and reviewed with the characteristics of the predictors (i.e., drought factors) and predictands (i.e., drought indices). Then, three major challenges–difficulty in model generalization, model resolution and feature selection, and saturation of forecasting skill improvement–were discussed, which led to provide several future research directions of satellite-based drought forecasting.},

abstract = {Drought is one of the factors that can cause wildfires. Drought is related to not only the occurrence of wildfires but also their frequency, extent and severity. In South Korea, most wildfires occur in dry seasons (i.e. spring and autumn), which are highly correlated to drought events. In this study, we examined the relationship between wildfire occurrence and drought factors, and developed satellite-based new drought indices for assessing wildfire risk over South Korea. Drought factors used in this study were high-resolution downscaled soil moisture, Normalized Different Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI), Normalized Different Drought Index (NDDI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Drought indices were then proposed through weighted linear combination and one-class support vector machine (One-class SVM) using the drought factors. We found that most drought factors, in particular, soil moisture, NDWI, and PCI were linked well to wildfire occurrence. The validation results using wildfire cases in 2018 showed that all five linear combinations produced consistently good performance (> 88% in occurrence match). In particular, the combination of soil moisture and NDWI, and the combination of soil moisture, NDWI, and precipitation were found to be appropriate for representing wildfire risk.},

Widely used multi-spectral satellite image-based approaches for burned area detection have a problem in that they do not work under cloudy conditions. Therefore, in this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Europe Space Agency, which can be collected in all weather conditions, were used to identify forest fire damaged area based on a series of processes including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. Four forest fire cases, which occurred in Gangneung{\textperiodcentered}Donghae and Goseong{\textperiodcentered}Sokcho in Gangwon-do of South Korea and two areas in North Korea on April 4, 2019, were examined. The estimated burned areas were evaluated using fire reference data provided by the National Institute of Forest Science (NIFOS) for two forest fire cases in South Korea, and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) for all four cases. The average accuracy using the NIFOS reference data was 86% for the Gangneung{\textperiodcentered}Donghae and Goseong{\textperiodcentered}Sokcho fires. Evaluation using dNBR showed an average accuracy of 84% for all four forest fire cases. It was also confirmed that the stronger the burned intensity, the higher detection the accuracy, and vice versa. Given the advantage of SAR remote sensing, the proposed statistical processing and K-means clustering-based approach can be used to quickly identify forest fire damaged area across the Korean Peninsula, where a cloud cover rate is high and small-scale forest fires frequently occur.},

abstract = {In South Korea with forest as a major land cover class (over 60% of the country), many wildfires occur every year. Wildfires weaken the shear strength of the soil, forming a layer of soil that is vulnerable to landslides. It is important to identify the severity of a wildfire as well as the burned area to sustainably manage the forest. Although satellite remote sensing has been widely used to map wildfire severity, it is often difficult to determine the severity using only the temporal change of satellite-derived indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). In this study, we proposed an approach for determining wildfire severity based on machine learning through the synergistic use of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar-C data and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument data. Three wildfire cases–Samcheok in May 2017, Gangneung{\textperiodcentered}Donghae in April 2019, and Goseong{\textperiodcentered}Sokcho in April 2019–were used for developing wildfire severity mapping models with three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine). The results showed that the random forest model yielded the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy of 82.3%. The cross-site validation to examine the spatiotemporal transferability of the machine learning models showed that the models were highly sensitive to temporal differences between the training and validation sites, especially in the early growing season. This implies that a more robust model with high spatiotemporal transferability can be developed when more wildfire cases with different seasons and areas are added in the future.},

abstract = {Drought affects a region's economy intensively and its severity is based on the level of infrastructure present in the affected region. Therefore, it is important not only to reflect on the conventional environmental properties of drought, but also on the infrastructure of the target region for adequate assessment and mitigation. Various drought indices are available to interpret the distinctive meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological characteristics of droughts. However, these drought indices do not consider the effective assessment of damage of drought impact. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of satellite-based drought indices over North Korea and South Korea, which have substantially different agricultural infrastructure systems to understand their characteristics. We compared satellite-based drought indices to in situ-based drought indices, standardized precipitation index (SPI), and rice yield over the Korean Peninsula. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM), and global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) data from 2001 to 2018 were used to calculate drought indices. The correlations of the indices in terms of monitoring meteorological and agricultural droughts in rice showed opposite correlation patterns between the two countries. The difference in the prevailing agricultural systems including irrigation resulted in different impacts of drought. Vegetation condition index (VCI) and evaporative stress index (ESI) are best suited to assess agricultural drought under well-irrigated regions as in South Korea. In contrast, most of the drought indices except for temperature condition index (TCI) are suitable for regions with poor agricultural infrastructure as in North Korea.},

Although global high resolution LAI data are provided by European Space Agency using Sentinel-2 satellite images, they have not considered forest characteristics in model development and have not been evaluated for various forest ecosystems in South Korea. In this study, we proposed a LAI estimation model combining machine learning and the PROSAIL radiative transfer model using Sentinel-2 satellite data over a local forest area in South Korea. LAI-2200C was used to measure in situ LAI data. The proposed LAI estimation model was compared to the existing Sentinel-2 LAI product. The results showed that the proposed model outperformed the existing Sentinel-2 LAI product, yielding a difference of bias ∼ 0.97 and a difference of root-mean-square-error - 0.81 on average, respectively, which improved the underestimation of the existing product. The proposed LAI estimation model provided promising results, implying its use for effective LAI estimation over forests in South Korea.},

abstract = {The L-band (1.4 GHz) brightness temperature (TB) is interpreted by the zeroth-order approximation of the radiation transfer model, known as the $\tau$ - $\omega$ model. The soil moisture active passive (SMAP) mission facilitates the operational retrieval of global soil moisture (SM) through the $\tau$ - $\omega$ model. The operational SMAP SM retrieval algorithms demonstrate favorable alignment with the International SM Network (ISMN) and the SMAP core validation sites (CVSs). Nevertheless, the performance of these retrieval algorithms is reduced in densely vegetated areas or on rough surfaces, due to the smaller sensitivity of L-band TB to SM and less optimized parameterization. Therefore, this study proposed a deep neural network (DNN) model that can replace the currently used algorithms. The complex dielectric constant was simulated using ISMN data with the dielectric model to directly train DNN and determine the relationship between measured TB and retrieved dielectric constant. This involved establishing a correlation between the measured V- and H-polarized TB and the parameters from the SMAP SCA, i.e., surface temperature, vegetation water content (VWC), b, $\omega$ , and h. The challenge posed by the scale mismatch between point-based and SM data was effectively managed using the triple collocation analysis (TCA). The accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated using the ISMN and SMAP CVS and compared with the existing SM retrievals such as SCA-V, DCA, SMAP-IB, and the recently developed MCCA. The developed SM in this study demonstrated enhanced agreement with ISMN, SMAP CVS in situ SM data, and the Tambopata site located in the Amazon compared with existing SM retrievals. Moreover, by inversely tracking the developed DNN, we propose a novel method for parameterizing the $\tau$ - $\omega$ model that potentially improves the parameterization of the existing SMAP-based SM retrieval algorithms.},

abstract = {Three widely used primary soil moisture (SM) data sources, namely, in-situ measurements, satellite observations, and land surface models (LSM), possess different characteristics. This study combined three SM data sources using machine learning (ML) random forest, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and simple averaging ensemble approaches to produce improved daily SM data over the contiguous United States (CONUS). For each ML model, three schemes were tested using different independent variables, namely, satellite-derived, LSM-derived, and both. Triple collocation analysis (TCA) was adopted to address the scale mismatch problem between in-situ and coarse gridded SM data. The proposed approach was evaluated using the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), Soil Moisture Active Passive Core Validation Sites (SMAP CVS), and TCA. In the ISMN-based evaluation, the proposed ML-based ensemble generally produced better evaluation metrics and showed robust skills over topographically complex and densely vegetated regions where existing SM products showed poor skills. The SMAP CVS-based evaluation demonstrated that the ML ensemble approach yielded a better performance than the existing SM datasets, resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.78, unbiased root mean squared difference of 0.035 m3/m3, and bias of 0.006 m3/m3. In addition, the TCA results additionally confirmed that the ML-based ensemble had better spatiotemporal quality than the other SM products. The data-driven approach proposed in this study has three major novelties (1) the proposed ML-based method synergistically merges various data sources to improve SM; (2) the performance of the proposed ML-based SM was robust to topography and vegetation; and (3) the average ensemble of three ML models additionally improves performances. The SM time-series data generated by the proposed approach are expectedly suitable variables for environmental and climate applications over CONUS. The research findings suggest that ML algorithms can be effectively used for modeling dynamic soil moisture.},

abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a critical parameter in understanding the Earth&#x0027;s hydrological cycle and managing water resources. Remote sensing instruments, such as Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), can provide valuable long-term SM. However, compatibility issues may arise when integrating ASCAT SM retrieval with another retrieval, such as Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), a high-quality microwave radiometer-based SM retrieval. In this study, we propose a novel image-to-image translation approach based on the U-Net architecture to convert ASCAT SM data into the format of SMAP (ASCAT2SMAP). The resulting SM from the ASCAT2SMAP was evaluated using temporally separated SMAP data and independent in-situ SM measurement from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). In the separately divided test periods, ASCAT2SMAP showed good agreement with SMAP with R of 928, ubRMSD of 0.043 m3 &#x002F;m3, and bias of 0.002 m3 &#x002F;m3. When evaluating ASCAT2SMAP with ISMN data, it showed a better agreement than ASCAT and more similar metrics with SMAP. Moreover, we found that the ASCAT2SMAP is more robust to a problem of subsurface scattering than the original ASCAT SM. When simulating V-polarized brightness temperature from ASCAT2SMAP SM, it showed good agreement with ubRMSD of 5.602 K and bias of -0.135 K. Our results are expected to provide a valuable perspective preceding to creation of harmonized soil moisture datasets from different sensors, contributing to improved data integration and analysis in the field of geoscience and remote sensing.},
